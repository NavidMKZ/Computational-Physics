### Problem 1
We have a wave function like  $$\psi = A \sin(\pi \frac{x}{l})^4$$
at t = 0 
1. Find the constant A.
2. Find the wave function at t = $$\pi$$ by green function
3. Flot the wave function.

### Problem 2
Find the 5x5 matrix of $$e^{\frac{-i J_y \beta}{\hbar}}$$ for J=2.

### Problem 3
Find the matrix of $$d_{mm'} ^{J=2} (\beta)$$ by $$e^{\frac{-i J_y \beta}{\hbar}}$$.
